A Protocol for Open Source Modeling, Cooperative Production, and Para-Market Circulation

coldstart is a minimal, recursive protocol for the collective production and distribution of artworks outside of traditional market infrastructures. It operates as a para-institutional structure—not a gallery, not a marketplace, and not a brand, but something that runs alongside and against these ossified models. It provides a clear, forkable toolkit for organizing creative labor, coordinating production, and enacting distribution through transparent, on-chain contracts.

Rather than replacing the traditional art market, coldstart seeks to model a parallel infrastructure — one oriented around collaborative authorship, equitable fabrication, and versioned evolution over time. It draws on the logic of open-source software and DAO governance, but retools those forms toward the epistemic and aesthetic work of cultural production.

## What It Does

coldstart provides:

- A shared framework for submission, production, and distribution of editioned works  
- A smart contract that automates payments, royalties, and removes the need for centralized administration  
- A GitHub-based versioning system that documents and evolves the protocol with each cycle  
- A public-facing web storefront for para-market circulation of works  
- An open invitation to fork, modify, and reapply the model for other self-organized artist cohorts  

## Who It's For

coldstart is designed for artists, designers, and theorists who are:

- Interested in building collective infrastructure for production and distribution  
- Operating outside (or in critical relation to) traditional galleries and markets  
- Eager to engage with technological tooling like smart contracts, GitHub, and digital fabrication workflows  
- Committed to modeling alternatives, rather than merely critiquing dominant systems  

## How It Works

Each iteration follows a simple structure:

1. A cohort of 5–10 contributors is assembled  
2. Contributors submit work to a shared production partner  
3. A smart contract encodes royalties and automates sales through a shared online storefront  
4. After the edition sells, proceeds are automatically distributed among contributors and producers  
5. The cohort reconvenes to evaluate and iterate the protocol, publishing updates via GitHub  

coldstart is not fixed. It is designed to mutate.
